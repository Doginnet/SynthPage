## Project Overview

This project is a multi-page website with a retro-futuristic, synthwave aesthetic. It appears to be a portfolio or promotional site for a synthesizer enthusiast or a related brand called "SynthDom". The site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Bootstrap 5 for the responsive layout and jQuery for some interactive elements.

The website has several sections:
*   **Home Page (`index.html`):** The main landing page with a large header, introductory text, and links to other sections. It has a multi-layered structure with a "dropdown" to a "Page Two".
*   **Page Two (`index.html`):** A "Neon City" themed section with a distinct visual style, a gallery, and more promotional content.
*   **Page Three (`index.html`):** A "Chill Zone" with a curated list of themed "chill-zones" presented as image cards.
*   **Catalog (`catalog.html`):** A separate page to browse a catalog of synthesizers, with categories like "Analog Synths", "Digital Synths", etc.

The visual style is heavily influenced by synthwave and retro 80s aesthetics, with neon colors, glitch effects, and space-themed backgrounds.

## Building and Running

This is a static website with no complex build process. To run the project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

*   **Dependencies:** The project uses Bootstrap 5, which is included via a CDN. It also uses jQuery, which is included via a CDN.
*   **Running:** Open `index.html` in a web browser.
*   **Testing:** There are no automated tests for this project.

## Development Conventions

*   **Styling:** The project uses a combination of a main stylesheet (`styles.css`) and a catalog-specific stylesheet (`catalog.css`). The styling is highly customized to achieve the retro aesthetic.
*   **JavaScript:** The project uses jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling. The main script is in `script.js` and the catalog page has its own script in `catalog.js`.
*   **File Structure:** The project is organized with separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Assets like images and backgrounds are stored in the `assets` directory.
